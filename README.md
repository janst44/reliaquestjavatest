# Super important notes for hiring developer:
* Normally i would return a standardized ApiResponse with data minimally a message, but the requirements seemed to indicate just returning a different response per request, so i decided to err on the side of caution.
* For the integration test, I thought using a http mock would be the best way to test an external api (which is how I viewed the mockapi)
* I didn’t immediately see anything that I’d typically write unit tests for, but I’m open to discussing if there are areas you think would benefit from it.
* The retry functionality is set up to maximize the chance of getting a response from the external service assumming we want data to be as correct as possible (like if a delete didn't go through that could potentially be bad) I didn't go so far as to build anything more durable for communications, but that would definitely be more ideal. I mention this because you pointed out the need for scalability.

# ReliaQuest Coding Challenge

#### In this assessment you will be tasked with filling out the functionality of different methods that will be listed further down.

These methods will require some level of API interactions with Mock Employee API at http://localhost:8112/api/v1/employee.

Please keep the following in mind when doing this assessment: 
* clean coding practices
* test driven development 
* logging
* scalability

See the section **How to Run Mock Employee API** for further instruction on starting the Mock Employee API.

### Endpoints to implement (API module)

_See `com.reliaquest.api.controller.IEmployeeController` for details._

getAllEmployees()

    output - list of employees
    description - this should return all employees

getEmployeesByNameSearch(...)

    path input - name fragment
    output - list of employees
    description - this should return all employees whose name contains or matches the string input provided

getEmployeeById(...)

    path input - employee ID
    output - employee
    description - this should return a single employee

getHighestSalaryOfEmployees()

    output - integer of the highest salary
    description - this should return a single integer indicating the highest salary of amongst all employees

getTop10HighestEarningEmployeeNames()

    output - list of employees
    description - this should return a list of the top 10 employees based off of their salaries

createEmployee(...)

    body input - attributes necessary to create an employee
    output - employee
    description - this should return a single employee, if created, otherwise error

deleteEmployeeById(...)

    path input - employee ID
    output - name of the employee
    description - this should delete the employee with specified id given, otherwise error

### How to Run Mock Employee API (Server module)

Start **Server** Spring Boot application.
`./gradlew server:bootRun`

Each invocation of **Server** application triggers a new list of mock employee data. While live testing, you'll want to keep 
this server running if you require consistent data. Additionally, the web server will randomly choose when to rate
limit requests, so keep this mind when designing/implementing the actual Employee API.

_Note_: Console logs each mock employee upon startup.

### Code Formatting

This project utilizes Gradle plugin [Diffplug Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle) to enforce format
and style guidelines with every build. 

To resolve any errors, you must run **spotlessApply** task.
`./gradlew spotlessApply`
